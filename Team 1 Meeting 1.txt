Project Idea meeting 1

Market volatility during international conflict.  How does war/conflict impact the stock market.

	• What was the market behavior prior to the conflict?

	• What was it during the conflict?  

	• Did the size of the conflict have a proportional impact on the market price?

	• Was a certain sector impacted more than another?

Can we predict future market behavior based on the conflict?
